  Ask the court to change or end your 209A restraining order
subquestion: |
  If the court issued a 209A restraining order to protect you, and
  
  you need to change the order or end it, 
  
  you can file the [Plaintiff's Motion to Modify or Terminate an Abuse Prevention Order](https://www.mass.gov/doc/plaintiffs-motion-to-modify-or-terminate-abuse-prevention-order-gl-c-209a/download).  

  Only use this motion if:
  
  1. You already have a 209A Abuse Prevention Order,
  1. You are the person who asked the court for the order and
  1. you need to:
      * change the order, **or** 
      * end it.
  
  You need a copy of your restraining order to answer the next set of questions. 
  
  Note: If you are the defendant in this case and you need to ask the court to change or end the order, it is important to talk to a lawyer. [Massachusetts Legal Resource Finder](https://masslrf.org/en/triage/start/abuse_crime) is one place you can look for a lawyer.

# How do we implement this? Previously, in order
# to tell the user how many characters they had left
# more effectively, we put 'what to modify' and 'reason'
# on different pages. We asked both to make sure the user
# included the 'what' part. If the user said they need to
# terminate, though, and they tap to edit on the review screen
# and change to 'modify', they need to add the 'what' part.
# How do we properly prompt them to do that once we
# have the full affidavit? We can't split the full affidavit
# back up. Maybe we delete 'what' to modify if they switch
# to 'terminate' so we can then ask 'what' and combine the two
# instead of having 'reason' separately... not sure this
# can work out cleanly.
